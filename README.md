# v4-client-rust
dydx v4 client

minimally tested and not guaranteed to be functional. should not be used in prod. most public mainnet indexer endpoints will yeet you if you try to access them from a US IP. need to be a bit "creative" with testing. this is less feature rich than the dydx v4 supported python client

i know ~0 about Rust, so any and all suggestions are welcome!
